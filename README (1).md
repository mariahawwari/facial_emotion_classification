# Facial Emotion Classification Project

This project focuses on recognizing human facial emotions from images using deep learning techniques. It is based on the FER2013 dataset and leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify facial expressions into seven emotion categories.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a robust facial emotion recognition model that can classify images into:
- Angry
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happy
- Sad
- Surprise
- Neutral

## 📊 Dataset

- **Name**: FER-2013
- **Source**: [Kaggle - FER2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)
- Contains 35,887 grayscale images (48x48 pixels) of faces, each labeled with one of the 7 emotion classes.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: CNN (custom or pre-trained like VGG or ResNet)
- **Input Shape**: (48, 48, 1)
- **Output Layer**: Softmax (7 neurons for 7 classes)
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
